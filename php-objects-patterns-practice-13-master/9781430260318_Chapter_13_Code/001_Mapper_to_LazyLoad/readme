This NOT A WORKING APPLICATION -- it is provided to illustrate examples in 
PHP Objects Patterns and Practice.

The SQLite database and cached config files will be automatically placed under ./data
by default

# removes cache and db files
./quickteardownscript

# generates the database and tables
./quicksetupscript

# calls runner.php which is a very basic command line version of the app under woo/
# this creates a couple of venues and spaces
# note how the Request object automatically adapts to being run in a CLI context
./quickrunbasics

This code will likely fail at less than PHP 5.5 -- this is probably due only to code
that uses ::class to normalise class names. If you replace these lines with fully qualified
class names (eg: woo/domain/Venue) the code will likely run with PHP 5.3 or better

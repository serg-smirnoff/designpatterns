You can set up the sqlite db for the transaction script examples by running

php transaction-script-setup.php

There are some PHPUnit tests for some of the core examples -- those that present low level core classes. These should not be batch run (because there are clashing singletons of the same name in different source files -- not something you'd see in a real project). So run them individually:

phpunit test/listing12.01Test.php

There's also a little shell script: runalltests
